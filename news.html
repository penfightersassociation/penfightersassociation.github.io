      <h2>RIO Gel Crashes!</h2>
      <p>RIO Gel, a recently upgraded 2017 grip pen has undergone an injury on September 23 2019. The rear part of the pen to which the stopper is attached came off in the middle of a match, spewing out its neodymium ball magnets. Thankfully, none were lost. Fortunately shortly after the match, the pen was repaired using superglue, and is now back in the arena!</p>
