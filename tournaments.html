      Win: Gain 2 points<br>
      Lose: Don't gain any points<br>
      Sudden Death: 1 point for each player<br><br>
      At the end of a round, after all matches have gotten over, the 3 players with the least points will be eliminated. The rest will move on to the next round. The number of players eliminated can vary based on the number of players left. The last player standing is the champion.<br><br>
      Points get reset at the start of a new round. If you are playing with a borrowed pen, you start of with -5 points. The pens cannot have external modifications and upgrades in this season, but may be permitted in future seasons.<br><br>
      1st place: 100 credits<br>
      2nd place: 75 credits<br>
